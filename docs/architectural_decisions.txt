# Message Passing Strategies and Usage

I decided to consume the data from locations, which as described, had a high demand,
using for Grpc and publishing in a Kafka topic, to decouple from the other systems.

For frontend, I kept REST as it is well known in the industry, and most of programmers
have a knowledge on it.

Also, I splitted the location and person service, as location have a higher demand than
person service. Splitting it provides the ability to scale them separatly.
